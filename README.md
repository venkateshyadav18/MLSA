# 🚀 MISA - CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED
RESPONSES  

Welcome to **MISA (My Intelligent Smart Chatbot)** — your personal chatbot and virtual assistant project!

---

## ✨ About This Project  

I started by building a basic **Command-Line Chatbot** as part of task.  
The goal was to create a simple interaction where a user could chat with a bot, ask questions, and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, etc.  

Later, I expanded this project into a more realistic **AI Assistant** using **NLP concepts**, **external APIs**, and a **beautiful web interface** for a more natural experience.  
This shift represents my move from **beginner scripting to real-world AI applications**.
